# Talking Flight Monitor Quickstart

Thank you for installing Talking Flight Monitor (TFM). This document will give you the basics for using the software. See the links above for more extensive documentation. 

Note that this documentation is a work in progress, so check back frequently!

## Requirements
In order to use this software, you will need either [Microsoft Flight Simulator X](https://store.steampowered.com/app/314160/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_X_Steam_Edition/), or [Lockheed Martin Prepar3d](https://www.prepar3d.com/).

In order to read the nearest city to your aircraft, you will need a free [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org) account. Once you create the account, enable web access under your profile. 

You will need the latest version of Pete Dowson's [FSUIPC module](http://www.fsuipc.com). If you are using Microsoft FSX, you need version 4. 
Prepar3d requires version 5 or 6. In most cases, you do not need to purchase a registration for Talking Flight Monitor to work. However, if you plan to use TFM with the aircraft from A2A simulations, a registered version of FSUIPC is required.

For the detection of aircraft on ground to work, you will need some files generated by the Makerwys program by Pete Dowson. See the instructions below.
