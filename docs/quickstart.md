# Talking Flight Monitor Quickstart

This section will give you a brief overview of using the Talking Flight Monitor software. See the links in the navigation bar for more extensive documentation. 

Note that this documentation is a work in progress, so check back frequently!

## Requirements

### Simulator

In order to use this software, you will need either [Microsoft Flight Simulator X](https://store.steampowered.com/app/314160/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_X_Steam_Edition/), or [Lockheed Martin Prepar3d](https://www.prepar3d.com/). It is possible to use TFM with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, but it has not been extensively tested.

For TFM to obtain data from the simulator, you will need the latest version of Pete Dowson's [FSUIPC module](http://www.fsuipc.com). If you are using Microsoft FSX, you need version 4. 
Prepar3d requires version 5 or 6. In most cases, you do not need to purchase a registration for Talking Flight Monitor to work. However, the developer of FSUIPC has been a huge help to this project, so we encourage you to support him by registering.

For the detection of aircraft on ground, you will need some files generated by the Makerwys program by Pete Dowson. See the instructions below.

### Screen Reader

TFM will speak through your existing screen reader, if you have one running. We currently support NVDA and JAWS. If you don't have a screen reader, the system can output through Microsoft SAPI.
