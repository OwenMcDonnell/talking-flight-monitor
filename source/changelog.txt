## Talking flight monitor 22.9.2 Preview release notes

### What's new?

* Glare Shield
    * EFIS not included see [the blog post](https://www.talkingflightmonitor.com/2022/09/04/pmdg-737-rebuild-series-week-15-tfm-preview-released-glare-shield-progress-and-navigraph-support/) for the reason.
    * Warnings panel
* MCP boxes
    * Speed box - Redesigned user interface and performance improvements.


        ### Bug fixes
* ILS announcements used SAPI even if 'use SAPI voice for ILS readouts' was turned off.

### Known issues

* Since all offsets are turned on, there may be some double/tripple announcements of the same control state. Examples may include the parking break announcing itself twice after turning it on or off once.
* The PMDG 747 has an approach mode light that turns on when on final. This usually happens after the ILS is active. TFM uses this light to determine when it should start reading signals from the nav radios. Since the app light and the approach mode switch are different, TFM can start reading ILS signals before approach mode is turned on. This is an issue, but the side affect is a desired feature. We will look into this more during the 747 rebuild cycle.

### FS2020 notes and reminders
* The latest builds of fs2020 broke keyboard navigation.
* You can still use a controller (XBOX/PS/5) to navigate the UI.
* PMDG 73X for FS2020 hasn't released an SDK yet. TFM will not work until the SDK is released.
