## Talking flight monitor 22.5.1 release notes

### What's new?
See [Developer update 5/12/2022](https://www.talkingflightmonitor.com/2022/05/12/developer-update-5-12-2022/) for details on the features included with this release. This is a hotfix release to fix some of the new features in the blog post.
* ILS: The destination runway window no longer crashes when loading runways without an ILS. The temporary fix excludes any runway without an ILS.
* ILS: the glide slope position is based on the aircraft. Not the other way around. EX: "1500 above" means that the aircraft is 1500 feet above the glide slope, not below it.


### Known issues
* see [Developer update 5/12/2022](https://www.talkingflightmonitor.com/2022/05/12/developer-update-5-12-2022/) for known issues with new features.
* There is no keyboard command to restart TFM. Restart it from the notification tray icon.
* The announce perf init complete setting on the PMDG page of TFM settings is not working at this time.
* TFM incorrectly announces aircraft instrument states in the FS2020 A320 Neo. A reminder that FS2020 is not supported by TFM, and usage results my not be as expected.
