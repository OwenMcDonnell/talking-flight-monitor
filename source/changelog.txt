### Bug fixes

* Users can now turn on/off the ground power in the electrical panel.
* Turned on the pre-existing offsets to make the preview releases usable by all users.
* The above/below announcements now indicate up/down. Up = glide slope is above you and down = glide slope is below you.

### Known issues

* Since all offsets are turned on, there may be some double/tripple announcements of the same control state. Examples may include the parking break announcing itself twice after turning it on or off once.
* The ILS readouts stop when approach mode turns off.
* The new ILS feature may not work as expected in the PMDG 747.

### FS2020 notes and reminders
* PMDG 737-700 for FS2020 hasn't released an SDK yet. TFM will not work until the SDK is released.
* The announce perf init complete setting on the PMDG page of TFM settings is not working at this time.
* TFM incorrectly announces aircraft instrument states in the FS2020 A320 Neo. A reminder that FS2020 is not supported by TFM, and usage results my not be as expected.
