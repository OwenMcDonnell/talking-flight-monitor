•	PMDG 737: [, Shift + s, and [, Shift + M displays the MCP speed box.
•	PMDG 737: Pilots can now set mach speed in the MCP speed box.
•	PMDG 737: The speed box now indicates when MCP or FMC is controlling the MCP speed.
•	PMDG 737: Speed intervene now works in the MCP speed box.
•	PMDG 737: MCP speed box now honors display of mach and indicated air speed.
•	PMDG 777, PMDG 737: Pressing Escape or pressing Alt+F4 on the MCP boxes closes them.
•	PMDG 777, PMDG 737: MCP boxes remember previous system focus when displaying them while in the same flight.

New hotkeys in the PMDG 777 MCP speed box:
alt+t = autobrake RTO
alt+o = autobrake off
alt+d = autobrake disarm
alt+1 = autobrake 1
alt+2 = autobrake 2
alt+3 = autobrake 3
alt+b = speedbrake

while speedbrake has focus:
home or , toggles speedbrake arm/off
end or . = speedbrake 100%
/ = speedbrake 50% (TFM will say 48%).
left/down = decrease speedbrake value until it becomes armed, then off.
right/up = increase speedbrake value.

* 2.0 alpha 18.1:
fix for CDU execute key and message indicators not reading in PMDG 777.

Known issues:
•	Installing the new version requires a reset of user settings. We are still trying to figure out how to carry settings from a major version to the next.
