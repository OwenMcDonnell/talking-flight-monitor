## Talking flight monitor 22.11.1 Preview release notes

### What's new?

* Lower forward panel
* Keyboard help.
    * Press right bracket (]), then question mark (?) to turn it on.
    * Press the fully qualified keyboard command. Example: right bracket (]), then A.
    * TFM will describe the keyboard command instead of performing its action.
    * Press right bracket (]), then question mark (?) again to turn it off.
* A quick help dialog that appears on TFM startup. Check the 'don't show me this again.' option in the dialog to hide it forever.
* Special characters such as the left bracket ([) and right bracket (]) are correctly displayed in the keyboard manager.

    ### Bug fixes

* PMDG 737: Added master caution/warning reset buttons to the Glare shield/warnings panel
    * PMDG 737 cockpit performance improvements.


### MSFS 2020 support

Covers initial support for the PMDG 737 series of aircraft for MSFS 2020. To ensure everything works, you will need the following installed on your PC/laptop.
* TFM 22.11.0 preview or later.
* MSFS 2020 update 11or later.
* FSUIPC 7.3.14 or later.
* First officer next for PMDG 737 aircraft.
* One or more of the following aircraft.
    * PMDG 737-600 for MSFS
    * PMDG 737-700 for MSFS
    * PMDG 737-800 for MSFS
    * PMDG 737-900 for MSFS

### Known issues

* PMDG 737: There isn't any way to turn on/off generators, APU generators, or buses in the electrical panel. A fix will be in a future update. Until now, use apps such as First officer to perform startup/shutdown flows.
* TFM: Vatsim mode is unstable at best. We feel it has something to do with Vatsim servers. Use at your own risk.
* TFM: Since all offsets are turned on, there may be some double/tripple announcements of the same control state. Examples may include the parking break announcing itself twice after turning it on or off once.
* TFM: The PMDG 747 has an approach mode light that turns on when on final. This usually happens after the ILS is active. TFM uses this light to determine when it should start reading signals from the nav radios. Since the app light and the approach mode switch are different, TFM can start reading ILS signals before approach mode is turned on. This is an issue, but the side affect is a desired feature. We will look into this more during the 747 rebuild cycle.
* MSFS/TFM: When the MSFS airports database is loaded, MSFS sound seems to buffer for some users when the MSFS window is not the active window. This appears to be a computer performance issue. We remind users to ensure all PC requirements meet at least the minimum required for MSFS, as well as any additional requirements imposed by the aircraft used at the time.
* MSFS/PMDG: The speed brake works as expected. It will report different values than the P3D version of the 737 though.
* MSFS/PMDG: Keyboard is no longer an option group under PMDG setup/options in the FMC. You will need to use TFM's panels/controls  or a 3rd party keyboard manager instead.
