### Known issues

* There is no way to disengage auto pilot or auto throttle. This will come in a future preview.
* TFM: Vatsim mode is unstable at best. We feel it has something to do with Vatsim servers. Use at your own risk.
* TFM: Since all offsets are turned on, there may be some double/tripple announcements of the same control state. Examples may include the parking break announcing itself twice after turning it on or off once.
