## Talking flight monitor 23.1.2 Preview release notes

### What's new?
### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where The heading box would display for the PMDG 737, PMDG 747, and freeware aircraft. Pressing left bracket ([), then SHIFT+H now displays the heading box for the PMDG 737.

### Known issues

* The PMDG 747 Overhead Maint/Electrical panel controls do not work.
* PMDG747: The Glare Shield/MCP is not included in the cockpit panels window. It will be added in a future release.
* PMDG747: The Glare Shield/MCP is not included in TFM settings. It will be added in a future release.
* PMDG747: The Overhead Maint/Electrical panel is not in TFM settings. It will be added in a future release.
* PMDG737: The audio/comms panels are not finished yet. Use the ACP panel at your own risk.
* PMDG 737: There is no way to disengage auto pilot or auto throttle. This will come in a future preview.
* TFM: Vatsim mode is unstable at best. We feel it has something to do with Vatsim servers. Use at your own risk.
* PMDG737/PMDG747: Old versions of aircraft announcements are still turned on. They will be permanently turned off in a future release.
