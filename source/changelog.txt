### Known issues

* TFM/MSFS: The airports database is too large to load all at once. This requires an airports database redesign. Paul Henty is taking care of this, and we will hear back in a few weeks.
* PMDG747: The Glare Shield/MCP is not included in the cockpit panels window. It will be added in a future release.
* PMDG747: The Glare Shield/MCP is not included in TFM settings. It will be added in a future release.
* PMDG737: The audio/comms panels are not finished yet. Use the ACP panel at your own risk.
* PMDG 737: There is no way to disengage auto pilot or auto throttle. This will come in a future preview.
* TFM: Vatsim mode is unstable at best. We feel it has something to do with Vatsim servers. Use at your own risk.
* PMDG737/PMDG747: Old versions of aircraft announcements are still turned on. They will be permanently turned off in a future release.
