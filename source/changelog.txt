### What's new?

#### PMDG 747

* The Overhead Maint/Electrical panel controls now work.
* Added Overhead Maint/Fuel panel.

#### Weather

* Pressing the keyboard command for wind will now give basic wind layer info. Go to TFM settings/Weather/Wind command to include or exclude them from the wind command's output.
* Added a new feature called cloud command. It provides access to cloud information on demand. Access with right bracket, SHIFT+O.
* The cloud command (above) is customizable. Navigate to TFM settings/weather/cloud command to see its available options.
* Added a new feature named cloud tracking. It automatically announces in/out of cloud status messages when the aircraft enters/exits a cloud layer. Toggle it on/off with right bracket, CONTROL+O.
* Added a new setting for cloud tracking (above) that toggles between SAPI or screen reader output.

* The PMDG 737 shows its own heading box instead of the freeware aircraft set heading window.
* The build database will only be visible when a simulator is loaded.

### Known issues
* PMDG 747: Some panels are excluded from TFM because the controls are write-only with no clear explanation on the control's settings. Those panels will appear in this section. We will keep everyone updated if the state of the panels change.
* PMDG747: The Glare Shield/MCP is not included in the cockpit panels window. It will be added in a future release.
* PMDG747: The Glare Shield/MCP is not included in TFM settings. It will be added in a future release.
* PMDG737: The audio/comms panels are not finished yet. Use the ACP panel at your own risk.
* PMDG 737: There is no way to disengage auto pilot or auto throttle. This will come in a future preview.
* TFM: Vatsim mode is unstable at best. We feel it has something to do with Vatsim servers. Use at your own risk.
* PMDG737/PMDG747: Old versions of aircraft announcements are still turned on. They will be permanently turned off in a future release.
