    * Press the fully qualified keyboard command. Example: right bracket (]), then A.
    * TFM will describe the keyboard command instead of performing its action.
    * Press right bracket (]), then question mark (?) again to turn it off.
* A quick help dialog that appears on TFM startup. Check the 'don't show me this again.' option in the dialog to hide it forever.
* Special characters such as the left bracket ([) and right bracket (]) are correctly displayed in the keyboard manager.

])

    ### Bug fixes

    * The MSFS airports database no longer causes GPU, CPU, and code matrix overruns.
    * Added Gen 1, gen 2, APU 1, APU 2, and transfer buss off buttons to electrical panel.
* PMDG 737: Added master caution/warning reset buttons to the Glare shield/warnings panel
    * PMDG 737 cockpit performance improvements.

### Known issues

* The airports database section of TFM settings only has a P3D database location. A fix will come in a future TFM build.
* Pressing right bracket (]), then Shift+C will produce an error if there isn't a Bingmaps API key provided. A fix will come in a future build.
* The PMDG 737 cockpit panels window and the FMC window still need performance optimizations and may slightly lag. Fixes will come in a future build.
* TFM repeatedly announces some indicators as on then off. The prominant ones are the auto pilot and auto throttle disengage lights found in the forward panel/CDU segment. This is expected because these lights blink under certain conditions. If they get spammy, turn them off in TFM settings.
    * Open TFM settings with right bracket (]), then Ctrl + comma (,).
    * Navigate to PMDG and press right arrow to open the group.
    * Arrow down to 737 speech events and open it with right arrow.
    * Navigate to Forward group and open it with right arrow.
    * Navigate to the MCP item.
    * Check the items to speak and uncheck the items to remain silent.
    * Press the OK button to save and close.
* There is no way to disengage auto pilot or auto throttle. This will come in a future preview.
* TFM: Vatsim mode is unstable at best. We feel it has something to do with Vatsim servers. Use at your own risk.
* TFM: Since all offsets are turned on, there may be some double/tripple announcements of the same control state. Examples may include the parking break announcing itself twice after turning it on or off once.
